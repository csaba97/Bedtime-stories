It all began with a young boy named\r\nDakota.\r\nDakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. The nights\r\nwere getting cooler. Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough\r\nsunlight left to do two things.

Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the\r\ndark.\r\nDakota's mother was worried that something had happened. She went looking for Dakota.\r\nNot long after, she heard the boys. She had mixed feelings. She was happy to see Dakota\r\nbut she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother.\r\nShe wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very\r\nquietly. Then she picked up a twig and threw it. The twig hit the ground making noise. It\r\ncaught the boys' attention. She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. The\r\nboys jumped. The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan\r\nsounded through her fingers.\r\nThe boys were definitely scared. But Dakota was the brave one. He ventured forward. The\r\nmother moaned again; she threw another twig. The boys were transfixed. Once more the\r\nmother moaned in a low and deep voice, \"Listen to your mother.\"\r\nThe boys dropped everything and ran. The mother could not hold back her laughter and the\r\nboys, hearing this, scurried home even faster.\r\nAfter the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found\r\nDakota in tears.\r\nDakota exclaimed, \"Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.\"\r\nHis mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. From then on when\r\nDakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, \"The boogie-man will scare you if\r\nyou misbehave.\"", 2,2,"2018-12-21", 1.5, 100);
